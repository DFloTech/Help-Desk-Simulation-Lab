ðŸ”§ Setting Up a Simulated Exchange Server in Your Lab

Since you donâ€™t have a real Exchange server,  can still simulate one by creating a DNS record in your Active Directory DNS zone. This way, when you (or Outlook) try to reach ex01.lab.local, it will resolve to an existing machine (like DC01).

ðŸ›  Steps

Log into DC01 â†’ Open DNS Manager (dnsmgmt.msc).


Expand Forward Lookup Zones â†’ lab.local.


Right-click â†’ New Host (A or AAAA).

Name: ex01

IP Address: (Use DC01â€™s IP, e.g., 192.168.1.10)

Click Add Host.


Confirm the new record appears as:

ex01.lab.local    A    192.168.1.10


From a client machine (PC02), test by running:

ping ex01.lab.local


You should get replies from DC01â€™s IP address.


âœ… Benefits of This Setup

Makes tickets involving mail server connectivity look realistic.

Can be reused in all tickets where Exchange/Outlook is mentioned.

Lets you demonstrate knowledge of DNS, mail flow simulation, and connectivity testing.
